# Python_Open_Channel_Design
Open Channel Design Automation in Python
This Python tool automates the design of open channels (rectangular and trapezoidal) using Manning's equation. It eliminates the guesswork and tedious iteration usually associated with Excel or manual trial-and-error methods.

It supports:
#1 Customizable cross-sectional geometry (rectangular, trapezoidal)
#2 Velocity constraint checks to ensure stable, non-scouring flows
#3 Automatic freeboard calculation
#4 Visualization of velocity-depth profiles

Ideal for:
#1 Water resources engineers
#2 Stormwater drainage designers
#3 Irrigation planners
#4 Civil engineering educators and students

ðŸ’¡ Key Features
#1 Manningâ€™s equation solver using Brentâ€™s method
#2 Configurable slope, roughness (n), and side slopes
#3 Outputs key hydraulic parameters: velocity, hydraulic radius, area, etc.
#4 Velocity compliance checks (min & max)
#5 Matplotlib plot for velocity-depth visualization

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Clone the repo and try out the examples in the main script. The tool can easily be extended for batch processing, integration with GIS, or report generation.

ðŸ“Œ Built by engineers, for engineers â€” because time spent tweaking Excel formulas could be better spent solving real drainage challenges.
